## School Management Application

I learned to use GraphQL and MongoDB thanks to the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-zero-to-hero

From connecting to the MongoDB database through Robo 3T and Docker, to the installation of npm, nest, TypeORM, uuid, and GraphQL dependencies, and the use of all the old and new decorators that were introduced and re-introduced throughout this course...

And last but not least, the use of the GraphQL Playground, which is amazing.

Commands used:
```
npm new graphql-mongodb
npm install graphql graphql-tools apollo-server-express @nestjs/graphql
npm run start:dev
nest g module lesson
npm install typeorm @nestjs/typeorm mongodb @types/mongodb
nest g service lesson --no-spec
npm install uuid
npm install class-validator class-transformer
nest g module student
nest g service student --no-spec
```
